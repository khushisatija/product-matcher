# Product Matcher

A web application that utilizes Google Vision API to identify and match products from uploaded images or URLs with a preloaded product catalog. 
This application is designed to match products in the following categories of **women's clothing**:
- **Tops**: Includes t-shirts, crop tops, and other upper wear.
- **Dresses**: Covers a variety of styles like bodycon, A-line, maxi, and more.
- **Sweatshirts and Hoodies**: Includes casual and cozy outerwear options.
The system uses **Google Vision API** to detect labels from uploaded images and matches them with preloaded product metadata stored in `products.json`.
